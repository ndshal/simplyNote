## Dependencies

For everything to work, various dependencies are managed by Yarn on the frontend and Ruby's Bundler on the backend.

Important packages include
  * **BCrypt**, for salting and encryption of user passwords.
  * **react-router v4**, for manipulation of browser history.
  * **redux-thunk**, a middleware that helps facilitate sending AJAX requests.
  * **babel**, for transpiling ES6 code for cross browser deployment.
  * **webpack**, for bundling together a large, modular JS file structure.
